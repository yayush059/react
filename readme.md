# What are Hooks?

Hooks are functions introduced in React 16.8 that allow you to use state and other React features in functional components. They enable developers to manage local component state, handle side effects, and utilize lifecycle methods without the need for class components. Hooks provide a more direct API to the React concepts you already know (state, lifecycle, context, etc.), making functional components more powerful and easier to work with.

## Key Benefits of Hooks

- **Simplified Logic**: Hooks enable you to organize logic in a more manageable way without the complexity of class components.
- **Reusability**: You can create custom hooks to encapsulate and reuse stateful logic across components.
- **No Class Syntax**: Hooks allow you to use state and other features without writing class-based components, leading to cleaner and more concise code.

### Commonly Used Hooks

Some of the most commonly used hooks include `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, `useReducer`, `useRef`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`, and custom hooks.


# Summary of React Hooks

- **`useState`**: Adds state to functional components.
- **`useEffect`**: Handles side effects and lifecycle events.
- **`useContext`**: Accesses context values.
- **`useReducer`**: Manages more complex state logic.
- **`useRef`**: Accesses DOM elements or stores mutable values.
- **`useMemo`**: Memoizes expensive computations.
- **`useCallback`**: Memoizes callback functions.
- **Custom Hooks**: Encapsulates reusable logic.

In React, routing is used to handle navigation between different views or pages of a web application. React is a single-page application (SPA) framework, meaning that it loads a single HTML file and dynamically updates the content based on the current view, rather than loading multiple separate HTML pages from the server.

### what is react-Router ?

The **React Router** library is commonly used for routing in React. Here are some key reasons for using routing:

### 1. **Navigation Without Page Reloads**
   - Routing allows navigation between different parts of an application without reloading the page. This improves the user experience by making the app feel faster and more responsive.

### 2. **Manage URLs**
   - Routing enables you to map different URLs to specific components or views. Each URL can represent a different "page" or "section" in the app, helping with SEO and making the app more user-friendly.

### 3. **Dynamic Routing**
   - You can create dynamic routes that change based on parameters or user input, such as `'/user/:id'` for displaying different user profiles based on the URL.

### 4. **Conditional Rendering**
   - Routes help conditionally render different components based on the URL. This allows you to control what content is displayed without needing complex state management.

### 5. **URL History Management**
   - React Router integrates with the browser's history API, which means users can use the back and forward buttons to navigate through the app like they would with traditional web pages.

### Example with React Router:

```jsx
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';
import Home from './components/Home';
import About from './components/About';

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Switch>
        <Route path="/about" component={About} />
        <Route path="/" component={Home} />
      </Switch>
    </Router>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In this example, the `Router` component wraps the app, the `Switch` ensures only one route is rendered at a time, and `Route` components define which component should render based on the URL path.

### what is Context ?

In React, **Context** is a feature that allows you to share data between components without having to pass props manually at every level of the component tree. It is particularly useful when multiple components need access to the same data, such as themes, authentication, or user settings, without prop drilling (passing props through many intermediate components).

### Key Features of React Context:
1. **Global State Management**: Context provides a way to share values globally across components without needing to pass them down explicitly via props at each level.
2. **Avoids Prop Drilling**: It helps avoid "prop drilling," where props have to be passed through several layers of components just to reach a deeply nested component.
3. **Dynamic Data Updates**: When the context value changes, any component subscribed to that context will re-render automatically, reflecting the new value.

### How React Context Works:
1. **Create Context**: You create a context object using `React.createContext()`.
2. **Provide Context**: A context provider component supplies the context value to its child components.
3. **Consume Context**: Components that need the context value can access it using the `useContext` hook (for functional components) or `Context.Consumer` (for class components).

### Example: React Context in Action
Here's an example of how to create and use context in a React application.

#### Step 1: Create Context
```jsx
import React, { createContext, useState } from 'react';

// Create a context
const ThemeContext = createContext();

function App() {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState('light');

  return (
    // Provide the context value to child components
    <ThemeContext.Provider value={{ theme, setTheme }}>
      <Toolbar />
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  );
}

function Toolbar() {
  return (
    <div>
      <ThemeButton />
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### Step 2: Consume Context (Using `useContext` Hook)
```jsx
import React, { useContext } from 'react';
import { ThemeContext } from './App'; // Import the context

function ThemeButton() {
  // Access context using the useContext hook
  const { theme, setTheme } = useContext(ThemeContext);

  return (
    <button
      onClick={() => setTheme(theme === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light')}
      style={{ background: theme === 'light' ? '#fff' : '#333', color: theme === 'light' ? '#000' : '#fff' }}
    >
      Toggle Theme
    </button>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In this example:
- The `ThemeContext` is created using `createContext()`.
- The `ThemeContext.Provider` in the `App` component wraps the components that need access to the context. It provides the `theme` and `setTheme` values to all child components.
- The `ThemeButton` component uses the `useContext(ThemeContext)` hook to access the current theme and the function to toggle it.

### When to Use Context:
- **Theming**: Manage global themes (e.g., light or dark mode).
- **Authentication**: Provide authentication status or user information across components.
- **Global State**: Share data (e.g., app language, user preferences) across many components without prop drilling.

### Context API Limitations:
- **Overuse**: Context can be overused for state management, and itâ€™s better to use libraries like Redux or Zustand when managing large-scale or complex global states.
- **Re-rendering**: Context updates cause re-renders of components that consume the context. Care must be taken to avoid unnecessary re-renders, especially in performance-sensitive applications.

In summary, React Context is a powerful tool for managing global data and avoiding prop drilling, but it should be used thoughtfully to avoid performance issues.
